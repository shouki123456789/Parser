# Parser
AI to parse sentences and extract noun phrases.


This project is a natural language processing (NLP) tool for parsing English sentences using context-free grammar (CFG).
The goal is to determine the structure of sentences and extract noun phrase chunks, which are useful for understanding the meaning of the sentence.

## Introduction

Parsing sentences is a crucial task in NLP, as it helps in understanding the grammatical structure of a sentence. This project uses context-free grammar (CFG) to parse sentences and extract noun phrases. The parser is designed to handle a variety of sentence structures, and the grammar rules can be modified to improve the parser's accuracy.

## Features

* **Context-Free Grammar Parsing**: Define and use CFG rules to parse sentences.
* **Noun Phrase Chunking**: Extract noun phrase chunks that do not contain nested noun phrases.
* **Customizable Grammar Rules**: Easily modify CFG rules to suit specific sentence structures.
* **Tokenization**: Use NLTK's word_tokenize to preprocess sentences.
